You are analyzing a Project Authorization Form (PAF) document. Extract information with HIGH PRECISION and provide CONFIDENCE SCORES (1-10 scale) for each field.

- Company: Operating company name (e.g., "Eversource NH", "NSTAR Electric")

**HEADER FIELDS [OPTIONAL]:**
- Project Manager: Name of person managing project (look for "Project Manager" label)
- Project Sponsor: Name of executive sponsor (look for "Sponsor" or "Executive Sponsor")
- Project Initiator: Person who initiated the project (look for "Initiator" or "Requested By")

**FINANCIAL DATA (Extract from [5] Cost and Funding section):**

- Year 3 Cost: Third year expenditure
- Contingency Percent: Contingency as percentage (e.g., "15% contingency")
- Funding Source: "internal", "external", or "mixed"

**CONTENT SECTIONS [REQUIRED]:**
- Section [3] Project Scope: Extract the ENTIRE text of section 3, including all subsections and bullets
- Section [5] Cost and Funding: Extract the ENTIRE text of section 5, including all financial tables

**REVISION HISTORY:**
Extract all revisions from revision history table. For each revision, extract:
- Version: "Rev 1", "Rev 2", "Rev A", etc.
- Date: Revision date (YYYY-MM-DD format preferred)
- Description: Brief description of changes

**CONFIDENCE SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:**
For each field, provide a confidence score 1-10 where:
- 10: Field explicitly present with clear label, no ambiguity
- 7-9: Field present but label unclear or value requires interpretation
- 4-6: Field possibly present but significant uncertainty
- 1-3: Field not found or highly ambiguous

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return valid JSON matching this exact structure:
{
  "project_number": "string",
  "project_title": "string",
  "company": "string",
  "project_manager": "string or null",
  "project_sponsor": "string or null",
  "project_initiator": "string or null",
  "scope_text": "full text of section 3",
  "cost_text": "full text of section 5",
  "cost_breakdown": {
    "total_request": float or null,
    "year_1_cost": float or null,
    "year_2_cost": float or null,
    "year_3_cost": float or null,
    "contingency_percent": float or null,
    "funding_source": "string or null"
  },
  "revisions": [
    {"version": "string", "date": "string or null", "description": "string or null"}
  ],
  "confidence_scores": {
    "project_number": int (1-10),
    "project_title": int (1-10),
    "company": int (1-10),
    "project_manager": int (1-10),
    "project_sponsor": int (1-10),
    "project_initiator": int (1-10),
    "scope_text": int (1-10),
    "cost_text": int (1-10)
  }
}

**IMPORTANT:**
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text
- If a field is not found, use null (not empty string)
- Be conservative with confidence scores - uncertainty is acceptable
